<h2>My top 3 Anime of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3><u>Naruto</u></h3>

<p>My first big anime, containing more than 500eps. Just love the way how it is animated and all the characters in it were too good.</p>
<h3><u>One Piece</u></h3>

<p>My favourite anime of all-time, despite of its long length(more than 1000eps and still airing) its story, world building is best I've seen so far. I love all the characters which are there in it. And ya it's been airing more than 20 yrs as of 2023.</p>
<h3><u>Attack on Titan</u></h3>

<p>Very new and different concept. Contains all the action and suspense which a viewer want to see in an anime.</p>
